String Creation methods:
	-Literal approach(1 obj in scp)
	-New Keyword(2 objs - heap,scp)

String class methods:
By using these methods everytime a new object is created.it is single and multi threaded and thread safe.

-length():
used to give number of chars in given string
EX: s.length()

-toCharArray():
used to convert String to character 
EX: s.toCharArray();

-toUpperCase():
used to convert lower case to upper case
EX:s.toUpperCase()

-toLowerCase():
used to convertuppercase to lowercase
EX:s.toLowerCase();

-equals():
used to check whether 2 strings are equal or not
EX:

-equalsIgnoreCase():
used to compare content by ignoring case
EX:

-CharAt():
used to find which character is there at that index.
EX:s.CharAt(0);

-indexOf():
used to find the first occurance where a particular char is in the string
EX:s.indexOf()

-lastIndexOf():
used to find the last occurrence.
EX: s.lastIndexOf();

-substring():
gives part of string(sub string) from given string
EX:s.substring(start,end+1);

DRAWBACKS OF STRING(lang):
-immutable
-everytime it creates new obj


STRING BUILDER:
-it is mutable.
-it will update existing string builder.
-single threaded.



STRING BUFFER:
-It is mutable.
-multi threaded and is thread safe.

methods in string buffer:
1.append()
used to merge 2 or more strings.

2.toString()
used to convert string buffer object to string.

3.reverse()
used to reverse the strinf buffer object.

4.chatAt()
extract char based on index

5.indexOf()
gives first occurrence given char

6.lastIndexOf()
gives the last occurrence

7.deleteCharAt()
used to delete char based on index

8.delete(stat,end):
used to delete range

9.subString()
used to partial string  from string

10.insert(i,value)
used to insert into a string by index.

11.replace(start,end,replacevalue)
used to replace content between sart and ending index.
