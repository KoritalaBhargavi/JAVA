Application:
	1.Front end - Html,css,JS
	2.middle ware- java,python,c,c#,Node
	3.Database - SQL,NOSQL

Types of application:
	1.Web application
	2.Mobile application
	3.Desktop application: 
		ex-calculator which can be accessed only on local PC 

Keywords:
	-we have 65 Keywords in java
	-We cannot use keywords as variables or class name. 

Data types :
	1.primitive: 8 types
		byte - 8 bits (-128 to +127)
		short - 1 byte (-32.. to +32..)
		char - 
		int - 4 bytes(-21cr to +21cr)
		float - 4 bytes
		double - 8 bytes
		long - 8 bytes
		boolean - 0 or 1

	2.Non-primitive:
		String : 
		Array : 
		List : 
		Stack : 
		Queue : 
	etc...

Variables:
Variable has type ,name ,value
	Naming variables:
		1.Camel case convention: ex - firstName
		2.Snake:ex-first_name
		3.spacial chars allowed: $,_

Default values: Only to the class level variables 
	int/long/short/byte - 0
	float/double - 0.0
	char- ' '
	boolean - 0

Unboxing & autoboxing :
	Unboxing:
		 refers to converting an object of a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive value.
	autoboxing:
		 refers to the conversion of a primitive value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class is called autoboxing.

Type Casting:
Used to change or upgrade the data type 

Operators:
	1.Arithmetic operators : add, sub, mul, div, modulus (+,-,*,/,%)


Program 1 : Hello_Numbers.java

import java.lang.*;
class Hello_Numbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte a=10;
        byte b=20;
        System.out.println(a+b);
        System.out.println(a-b);
        System.out.println(a*b);
        System.out.println(a/b);
        System.out.println(a%b);
    }
}

Learnings:

*Only global variables Can survive with no values as they are assigned default values.
*Local varibales possess error when no value is assigned to them.

Rules:
-In the defualt lines of the code only the Class name and Strings [] args have capitals in them other than them no words can have capitals.


Global Variable/Class variable:
	-They have global scope means they can used in the entire class 
	-They Can be accessed in the entire program
Local Variables/Method Variable:
	-They can only be used in the method they have been initialized in.
	-They cannot be accessed outside the method they are declared.

Comments:
Single line: we use  '//' for single line comment.
Multi line: we use "/*....*/" for multiple line comment.
