Project Goals with SQL Queries


1. Which products have the highest revenue?

SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;


2. What is the return rate by product?

SELECT p.product_name,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN o.return_status = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS return_rate
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;


3. How do different cities perform?
SELECT c.city, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.city
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;

4. What is the average eco-score of top-rated products?
SELECT AVG(eco_score) AS avg_eco_score
FROM products
WHERE rating >= 4.5;

ðŸ’¡ Cool Add-Ons:
Add a field like plant_a_tree_opted in orders to simulate eco-conscious customers ðŸŒ±

Add platform column: Nykaa, Mamaearth.com, Amazon

Integrate it into a Power BI or Tableau dashboard for visualization.
