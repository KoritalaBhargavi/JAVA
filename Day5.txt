String Initialization:

1.String CName="CIET";

2.String CName= new String("CIET");

JVM(JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE):

JVM is used to allocate memory.
It has 2 ways of storing:
	1.Stack - temporary  
	2.Heap - Permanent
	   |
	    -Heap - Used to store data which is created using new keyword.when we use new then it checks in 	Scp whether the value is there in Scp if not found 2 objects are created.
	   |
	    -String Constant pool(SCP)-Used to store String when you create a string only in literals approach 	only.

Ex:
	int a=16;
	float f1=38.4f;
These both are stored in stack when accessed the focus is navigated to the memory location.

MEMORY CLEANING:

	System.gc(); - 
		-IT is used to clean the unused, unutilized memory called "garbage collector".
		-It is available in System class and is default written by James gosling.


STRING COMPARISON:

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN == AND .equals()is
	O == compares address of the variables.
	O .equals() compares content of the variables.


METHODS AVAILABLE IN STRING CLASS:
1.length():used to check the length of the string.
2.equalas():checks whether both strings are equal.
3.parseInt(): Used to Convert (num)String to number, it is present in Integer class.


Types of classes:
1. Static Class:
A static class, in Java, is typically an inner static class.
It does not require an instance of an enclosing class to be instantiated.
Methods and variables of a static class can be accessed using the class name.

Syntax:
Classname.varible;
classname.method();

Ex:
Integer Class

2. Instance Class:
An instance class (non-static class) requires an object to be instantiated before its methods and variables can be accessed.
You do not need to use the class name; instead, you can call methods on an object instance of the class.

Syntax:
Instance.method();

Ex:
String class

Note:Integer and String class are present in lang package
