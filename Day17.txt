3.ENCAPSULATION:
	-Binding the data through variables.
	-It provides Security.
	-The security is achieved using "private" for variables.
	-In this we use getters and setters for getting and setting the values.
	-In this setters has parameters as they re used to set values.
	-for getters there are no parameters as they just return the values.
	-classes having setters and getters are called POJO.
	-POJO stands for Plain Old JAVA Object.

4.Polymorphism:
	-poly means many and morphs means many
	Ex: me and my relation with my family.

	1.compile time polymorphism(method overloading):

		-Before execution detecting the error.
		-methods having same name but different parameters.
		-Method overloading happens in same class.

	2.run time polymorphism(method overriding):
		-After running it displays errors.
		-Overriding happens with inheritance in order for the method to be overridden.
		-We cannot override the static methods only non-static methods are overridded.



ADVANTAGES OF OOPS:

1.SECURITY

2.CODE REUSEABILITY

3.MANAGABILITY

4.FLEXIBILITY
